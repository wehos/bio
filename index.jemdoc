== Short Bio
I am a Ph.D. graduated from [http://dse.cse.msu.edu/ DSE lab] at Michigan State University. My advisor is Professor [http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/ Jiliang Tang].\n
\n
I received my Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2021, and used to work with [https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ws390/ Prof. Weiwei Sun]. I am very grateful for the time I spent there.\n
\n
I was an intern in [https://www.didiglobal.com/ Didi Global] company from Oct
2019 to Mar 2020, [https://www.songguo7.com Songguo] company from
Oct 2020 to July 2021, [https://www.tigergraph.com/ Tigergraph] in Summer 2022 and [https://www.a9.com Amazon] in Summer 2023. I spent really nice time in those amazing companies, especially enjoying the startup atmosphere. 

My previous research focus is to apply graph neural networks and transformers to large-scale
real-world datasets, especially single-cell analysis. I'm also very interested in graph transformers, and have been maintaining a [https://github.com/ChandlerBang/awesome-graph-transformer paper list] related to it.
